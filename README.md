# School_District_Analysis

## Overview of Project 
Prior to the project, a comprehensize School District Analysis was preformed on collected data of school metrics and student performance. The analysis broke down performance of students based on grade and school as well as provided information regarding school spending and size. 

The purpose of this project was to recreate this analysis based on suspicion of academic integrity for the 9th grade reading and math scores for Thomas High School. The project completed below adjusts the analysis by removing the suspected dishonest scores to see how it impacted the School District Analysis.
